Particle analyzer software was developed in order to measure recycled fiber's length and diameter. Nevertheless, it can be used for different kinds of particles. Thanks to the built-in scripts the software is able to identify fibers from a grayscale image. Look the [report](https://github.com/piuLAB-official/Particle_analyzer/blob/main/Report.pdf) to know more about the results achieved with this software.
